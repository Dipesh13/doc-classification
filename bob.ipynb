Pogba knew he wanted to be a professional footballer from the very early days of kicking a ball around in the suburbs of Paris with his older twin brothers.But what sets a man who has won domestic and European titles and become an established France international apart from the dreamers who failed to make the grade? From joining Roissy-en-Brie as a six-year-old to signing a contract in England a decade later, BBC Sport explores the making of Pogba with those who knew him best.Pogba on winning, ping pong & deep-sea diving\""
